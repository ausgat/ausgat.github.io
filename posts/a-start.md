I started a blog again. I've lost track of how many there have been, but this one will be different. This one has an identity, a sense of purpose: It is here to make me happy. Everything I post is for my own enjoyment.

What does that entail? It means I'm going to post whatever I feel like posting. There will be no consideration for anyone who might be reading it. So, if trudging through a swamp of pointless drivel is your thing, stick around.
